## Sidia

The tasks were solved in Python and were developed during a test on codility and they were revised by me later on that day, June 3rd.

## Notas/Dificuldades:

- `I spent some time trying to figure out why task 1 was not working fine, there was something wrong on the size of the string causing a problem into loop. So I fixed and updated on this repository; #FIXED`
- `So I had a short time to understand task 3 and this task is still incomplete. #WorkingOnIt`
